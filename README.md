This is an experimental project.
-----------------------------

This repo aims to demonstrate AI project generation.
The project function is basic RESTful ingres and Redis operations with Go.
Almost all of the code bases are made via ChatGPT and Copilot.

The challenges met were with Mock generation, while the application code and infrastructure were AI-generated. For the project creation, I used an iterative approach, where, in case of an error, I just copied it from the console and pasted it into ChatGPT without any additional context. It was observed that adding context to errors is not necessary. Conversely, AI gets enough context out of the error and preceding prompts.
